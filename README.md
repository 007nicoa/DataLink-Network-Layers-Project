# DataLink-Network-Layers-Project
This is a project that simulates two hosts over a network layer and data link layer.
In DataLinkLayer.java created an implementation of a data link layer where there is a parity bit checker to detect errors in the transfer of data frames within a medium that randomly flips bits
In NetworkLayer.java created an implementation of a network layer where it creates and receives packets.
